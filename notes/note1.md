# buildhistory 
**buildhistory class**. 
This class records information about the contents of all packages built and about the images created by the build system in a Git repository where you can examine them. Build history
is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to add
```
INHERIT += “buildhistory”
BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT = “1”
```
The files in that directory give you detailed information on what makes up your image:
### image-info.txt: 
Overview information about the image in form of the most important variables, such as DISTRO, DISTRO_VERSION, and IMAGE_INSTALL
### installed-packages.txt:
A list of the package files installed in the image, including version and target information 
### installed-package-names.txt: 
Similar to the previous file but contains only the names of the packages without version and target information files-in-image.txt: A list of the root filesystem with directory names, file
sizes, file permissions, and file owner Simply searching the file installed-package-names.txt gives you information on whether or not a package has been installed.


# Image Features
The contents of images generated by the **OpenEmbedded build system** can be controlled by the IMAGE_FEATURES and EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES variables
**dev-pkgs image feature** adds the development packages, which typically include headers and other files required for development, for all packages installed in the root filesystem.
